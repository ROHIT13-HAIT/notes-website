### **CSS for Responsive Design**

Responsive design adjusts the layout based on screen size, improving user experience across devices.

- **Media Queries**: Allows for different styles based on device characteristics.
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
      font-size: 14px;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Flexbox and Grid**: CSS layout modules that create flexible, responsive layouts.
  - **Flexbox**: Ideal for one-dimensional layouts.
  - **Grid**: Ideal for two-dimensional layouts.
